A specialized Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool designed to analyze customer feedback for EdTech platforms in Bangladesh. It processes mixed-language datasets (English, Bengali, and phonetic "Banglish") to generate high-resolution semantic Word Clouds, providing stakeholders with immediate visual insights into user sentiment.

## 🧐 The Engineering Challenge
One of the core challenges in this project was handling **Complex Text Layout (CTL)** for the Bengali language.

### 🔴 The Problem
Standard Python libraries (`matplotlib`, `wordcloud`) often fail to render Bengali "Juktakkhor" (conjuncts) correctly on Windows environments.
* **Issue 1:** Letters appear broken or separated (e.g., `ক্ষ` rendering as `ক` + `ষ`).
* **Issue 2:** "Tofu" artifacts (square boxes `□□□`) appear due to missing font glyphs.
* **Root Cause:** The default text engine on Windows does not support complex Bengali shaping out of the box.

### 🟢 The Solution
To ensure production-grade visualizations, I implemented a three-step fix:
1.  **Environment Strategy:** Migrated the rendering pipeline to **Google Colab (Linux)**. Unlike Windows, the Linux environment correctly handles complex character shaping for Bengali script without requiring manual system patches.
2.  **Advanced Tokenization:** Instead of simple whitespace splitting (which breaks Bengali grammar), I implemented **`bnlp_toolkit`**. This library accurately tokenizes Bengali text, ensuring words are separated logically before visualization.
3.  **Font Engineering:** Integrated the **Kalpurush** TrueType font to force correct Unicode rendering, replacing incompatible system fonts.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Multi-Language Support:** Seamlessly handles English, native Bangla, and Banglish in the same dataset.
* **Smart Stopword Filtering:** Uses a hybrid filter removing common English (e.g., "the", "is") and Bangla (e.g., "এবং", "করা") noise words.
* **Production-Ready Output:** Exports images at **300 DPI** (Print Quality), suitable for professional business reports.
* **Automated Data Pipeline:** Auto-cleans `NaN` values, normalizes text types during ingestion, and handles missing file errors gracefully.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Core:** Python 3.10+
* **Data Processing:** Pandas (ETL)
* **NLP:** BNLP Toolkit (Bengali Natural Language Processing)
* **Visualization:** WordCloud, Matplotlib
